KartoffelKanaalPlugin
=====================

The KartoffelKanaalPlugin is a Bukkit plugin made for the Minecraft server "KartoffelKanaalServer" (kartoffelkanaal.servermc.nl).
This repository is actually ment to establish collaboration on developing of the KartoffelKanaalPlugin. The KartoffelKanaalServer is a dutch server, so the KartoffelKanaalPlugin.
I quickly want to mention that the KartoffelKanaalPlugin is a project for very simple purposes and that use of a version of the KartoffelKanaalPlugin is at own risk. The KartoffelKanaalPlugin is a charity project and is made by me (Vincent) and in the future hopefully someone I'm currently teaching to code. The plugin is thus a project made by non-professional developers and contains as a result possibily a lot of bugs, bad code,... .

The opensource doesn't make really sense in this project, but if you would find it useful, you're free (with some limitations described in LICENSE) to use the code. Good luck! :)

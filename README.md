KartoffelKanaalPlugin
=====================

The KartoffelKanaalPlugin (KKP) is a Bukkit plugin made for the Minecraft server "KartoffelKanaalServer" (kartoffelkanaal.servermc.nl).
This repository is actually ment to establish collaboration on developing of the KartoffelKanaalPlugin. The KartoffelKanaalServer is a dutch server, so the KartoffelKanaalPlugin.
I quickly want to mention that the KartoffelKanaalPlugin is a project for very simple purposes and that use of a version of the KartoffelKanaalPlugin is at own risk. The KartoffelKanaalPlugin is made by me (Vincent). The plugin is thus a project made by a non-professional developer and contains as a result possibily a lot of bugs, bad code,... .

The opensource concept doesn't make really sense in this project, but if you would find it useful, you're free (with some limitations described in LICENSE) to use the code. Good luck! :)
